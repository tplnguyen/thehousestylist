# thehousestylist

The House Stylist is a web application designed for the course Semantic Web

Run at http://localhost:5000/ while connected to the database Furniture (consists of furniture.ttl and furniture.rdf) in Stardog.


The webpage is also available @ http://www.few.vu.nl/~tnn720/
We however couldn't find the solution to connect the page to Stardog; therefore the click-functions don't work.
