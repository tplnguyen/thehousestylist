# thehousestylist

The House Stylist is a web application designed for the course Semantic Web


Run at http://localhost:5000/ while connected to the database "furniture" (consists of furniture.ttl and furniture.rdf) in the Stardog Triple Store.


The webpage is also available @ http://www.few.vu.nl/~tnn720/index2.html
We however couldn't find the solution to connect the page to Stardog; therefore the click-functions don't work.

How it is supposed to work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGhDjqG9dlQ
